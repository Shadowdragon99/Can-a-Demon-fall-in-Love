# Chapter 1: The Fated Meeting

It was a nice and cool February day when the high elf mage Himeko and her young apprentice, Cherri Cuelus arrived in the coastal city of Hulbury after Himeko had gotten an invitation from an old friend of Himeko’s to come and see her new collection of magical trinkets. Before going, however, both Himeko and Cherri decided to book a hotel room as Cherri wanted to use this opportunity to try the ice cream that Hulbury is known for and collect new ingredients to brew potions with. 

"What can I get you two?" asked the waiter, at first I wasn't listening as I was dazing off looking at the ships on the water and the sound of the sea birds.

"Cherri?" asked Himeko, my Master, as usual, she said it without even moving her lips. being born mute meant she needed to learn a new way to talk to others. her sing-song voice knocked me out of my daze

"Oh, my apologies, what did you say again?”

"No worries little miss, can I get your order?”

"Oh right" I chuckled a little and carefully read the menu. Despite being born in a coastal city I always hated seafood. "Um, can I just get a burger, french fries, and a cold soda please?”

"Of course miss, I'll get you two your meals right away" The waiter quickly left to place our orders with the chefs

"What did you get Master?”

"Oh just a mint milkshake and the weekly special, 'grilled Merwyrm and fries' I believe it was called

I chuckled a little as Master said what the name of the meal was, the first time I heard of Merwyrms being eaten. what a shame really, such mighty guardians of the depths being turned into a tourist food. after I started to wonder what sort of things I and Master would see when we meet up with my Master's old friend. I heard that outside of selling magical weapons, trinkets, and items, the shop also sells small magical creatures. 

"Master, what is the name of your friend again?”

"Emily Brimstone, a human sorceress of great magical skill and knowledge on magical trinkets. We used to work together on some projects while I still lived in Hulbury”

I was surprised to hear that Master and Miss Emily worked together, the little I know of her time in Hulbury she seemed to be the 'silent protector type.' Which did earn her the title of the 'silent guardian of Hulbury,' and that she mostly kept to herself. then my mind started to think about how great Miss Emily must be to have befriended my aloof Master, after a while our food finally came and it was the best burger I ever had! Master seemed to have enjoyed her 'grilled merwyrm' as well, she offered me to try it but I declined. After paying for the meal and ordering ice cream for myself we set out to visit Miss Emily's magic store.

As we walked I took in the sights of this bustling port city with streetfood vendors choking the streets as customers enjoyed the local specialties. Although I was born into a city like this one I grew up rich and was born into a noble family, meaning I rarely had the chance to go out and explore on my own. I was amazed to see someone riding a royal Manticore flying overhead, rarely do you see someone riding one of those amazing creatures, let alone in a populated city!

after what seemed like 10 minutes but was, in reality, an hour and a half we finally made it to Miss Emily's store, it was a breathtaking two-story building with a balcony above the main entrance with two limestone pillars and foundations. the building is painted in deep red that fades to yellow and then black closer to the roof, with the main door itself having engravings of two snakes and a crown with green-blue windows.

As we went inside I was taken away by how many items were on display, all the items were neatly sorted in rows for that specific type of item; potions, weapons, boots, scrolls, etc., and sitting at the reception desk was Miss Emily, a beautiful tall human with smooth light skin, bright red eyes, and long black hair that curls at the end. And wearing long bright red socks with black heels. a long red dress, a large crooked red hat. and a silver chain necklace with a gold star. 

"Himeko it's been so long!" Emily said with a soft Otrax accent, "And who may this be?"

I was got off-guard as I was busy looking at a set of light purple and silver armor when Miss Emily said that "I-I am Cherri. I am Miss Himeko's apprentice" At first I was quite timid talking to such a famous and powerful sorcerer but I quickly regained my composure.

"Well aren't you a cutie, you have such beautiful green hair and lake-green eyes, and soft copper skin"

I was got surprised by Miss Emily's compliments and even more so when she grabbed my hand, I brushed and parted my hair revealing two silver star earrings.

"Oh, what's wrong with your arm my dear?"

I looked at my right arm which was a wooden prosthetic "Oh this? I lost my right arm when I was young and got a replacement, it has an embedded rod that allows me to infuse my punches with magic" 

"I see. Now then what can I get for the two of you? After all I doubt you two came all the way here just to see me"

"Well," Master said as she looked around with her arms crossed "You did invite me here" 

"I did, didn't I? Anywho what would you two like to buy?"

I suddenly remembered the whole reason why I came with Master was to buy my friends and myself some new equipment, and with my birthday coming up get myself something special. I looked around and noticed a 2-feet tall sphere made out of amethyst with a smooth and shiny surface

"An Amethyst Dragon egg, heh you wouldn't believe what I had to do to get my hands on it."

"an Amythyst Dragon egg?" I thought to myself, it is very rare for someone to be selling a dragon egg, and if they do they usually sell out quickly. I remembered that I always wanted a dragon of some kind when I was a kid. "can I have it?" I asked without even thinking and I quickly tried to retract my question "wa-Wait what I meant to say was-"

"Don't worry my dear, of course, you can have it, hell I'll even give it to you for free"

"Really?" I said with my eyes sparkling and overtaken by Miss Emily's kindness

"Why of course, consider it my Gift to you for being such a good apprentice to my friend. Speaking of which, Himeko, why don't we head upstairs and catch up over some tea?"

"That would be wonderful, Cherri why don't you look around and pick out the things you want? Don't worry about the cost"

"Thank you, Master!" as Master and Miss Emily went upstairs I started to look around and pick out the items I wanted and things I thought my friends would like. While looking around I noticed what looked like a cage hidden away, out of curiosity I looked inside, and what I saw horrified me. in a small and dark cage covered in dry piss and blood with the bones of rats scattered across the cage was what looked like a Tiefling chained to the wall. Her arms and neck were chained to the wall with an iron mask covering her mouth, from the small openings I saw 12 teeth outside of her mouth and noticed that she only had one glowing yellow eye, with a hole where her left eye should be.

"he-Hello?" I asked without even thinking and I noticed one of the Tiefling's ears twitched and she looked up at me, as our eyes met I felt something within me stir and I felt a connection with the Tiefling as if we were destined to meet.

"Why does it feel like I knew her?"
